            <p>
              Onitsuka Tiger's first product was a basketball shoe resembling a straw sandal in many ways. 
              The design was discarded by many and Onitsuka returned to the  design stage to better acclimate his shoes for the way in which basketball players started and stopped on the floor.
              By adding cups and small spaces in the soles of his basketball shoes, Onitsuka made a more effective shoe in 1952 which soon became popular throughout Japan. 
              In 1955, the company increased its business to 500 sports shops across Japan.
              Onitsuka Tiger worked with marathon runner Toru Terasawa in 1953 to develop a running shoe that would keep long distance runners from developing blisters. 
              Ethiopian runner Abebe Bikila started wearing Onitsuka Tiger shoes in 1957, the first time in his running career he had ever worn shoes, convinced by Onitsuka that they would be superior to his barefoot style. 
              The shoes were also worn in 1958 by short-distance runner Oliver Skilton when he won bronze in the Continental European games. 
              In 1959, the sneakers brand launched the Magic Runner with improved technology on ventilation to prevent blisters and build comfort.
